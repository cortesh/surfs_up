# Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of the analysis is to compare temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Results: 

* Overall analysis is that the island of Oahu represents a great location for a surf and ice cream shop.
* This is because average temperatures only deviate on average by 3 degrees from the summer to the winter across several years of weather data.
* Minimum temperatures across several years are 64 and 56 degrees respectively but maximum temperatures are nearly identical
